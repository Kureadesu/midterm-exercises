            There are plenty of new technologies currently in development. Can you imagine how our life will be by 2030?
            These are some of the inventions that could change our life in 2030:

        <h2 class="subtitle">Sand batteries</h2>
        <p class="subtext3">
            Some of the most effective technologies for our future are simple and easy to implement.
            One of these innovations came from some Finnish engineers who discovered a technique to turn sand into a massive battery.
            tons of sand were loaded into a  metre steel container by these engineers.
            This sand was then heated with wind and solar energy.
            This heat can subsequently be transferred by a local energy company to warm buildings in the surrounding area.
            Energy can be stored in this manner for extended periods of time.
            All of this is accomplished through a process known as resistive heating.
            This is the process by which a substance is heated due to the friction of electrical currents. 
            The electricity traveling through sand and other non-super conductors generates heat that can be used for energy.

        <h2 class="subtitle">Intelligent exo-skeletons</h2>
        <p class="subtext3">
            exo-skeletons are usually used for artificial body parts (like leg prosthetics), and can also be used to create muscle memory for the disabled.
            They have already existed for years, However, as time has passed, technology has become increasingly remarkable
            Most notably, in recent years, we have seen technology become increasingly accessible to the young.
            The Atlas 2030 is the most advanced mobile medical exo-skeleton created exclusively for children, according to the company.
            While not yet commercially available, this technology has the potential to help children in the future by providing a pediatric lower-body medical exo-skeleton.
            This could aid with the walking of children with severe neuromuscular illnesses, cerebral palsy, or spina bifida.

        <h2 class="subtitle">Advancement of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <p class="subtext3">By 2030, computer processing power, speech recognition, image recognition, deep learning, and other software techniques will have improved exponentially.
            Similarly, natural language processing methods such as GPT-3 are continually being improved and outperformed. It will almost certainly progress to the point where artificial intelligence can pass the Turing Test.
            This is a test in which a human converses with a machine and asks it various questions.
            And if the machine can persuade that individual that it is human,
            it has passed the test. This could quickly lead to AI-generated virtual assistants that have the capability to carry nuanced conversations with you. And later, 
            this technology could carry over to characters in virtual worlds and video games.

            <h2 class="subtitle">Wearable electronics</h2>
            <p class="subtext3">
                We're talking about earbuds that can track your heart rate, contact lenses that can measure your blood sugar, temporary tattoos that can unlock doors using NFC technology, and other amazing stuff.
                Once they figure this out for consumer usage, it won't be long before you can have implants that track your vitals in real time, letting you know if you're having a heart attack before your heart does.
                It will help save lives.
