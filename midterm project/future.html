            There are plenty of new technologies currently in development. Can you imagine how our life will be by 2030?

        <h2 class="subtitle">Sand batteries</h2>
        <p class="subtext">
            Some of the most effective technologies for our future are simple and easy to implement.
            One of these innovations came from some Finnish engineers who discovered a technique to turn sand into a massive battery.
            tons of sand were loaded into a  metre steel container by these engineers.
            This sand was then heated with wind and solar energy.
            This heat can subsequently be transferred by a local energy company to warm buildings in the surrounding area.
            Energy can be stored in this manner for extended periods of time.
            All of this is accomplished through a process known as resistive heating.
            This is the process by which a substance is heated due to the friction of electrical currents. 
            The electricity traveling through sand and other non-super conductors generates heat that can be used for energy.

        <h2 class="subtitle">Intelligent exo-skeletons</h2>
        <p class="subtext">
            exo-skeletons are usually used for artificial body parts (like leg prosthetics), and can also be used to create muscle memory for the disabled.
            They have already existed for years, However, as time has passed, technology has become increasingly remarkable
            Most notably, in recent years, we have seen technology become increasingly accessible to the young.
            The Atlas 2030 is the most advanced mobile medical exo-skeleton created exclusively for children, according to the company.
            While not yet commercially available, this technology has the potential to help children in the future by providing a pediatric lower-body medical exo-skeleton.
            This could aid with the walking of children with severe neuromuscular illnesses, cerebral palsy, or spina bifida.

        <h2 class="subtitle">Advancement of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <p class="subtext">By 2030, computer processing power, speech recognition, image recognition, deep learning, and other software techniques will have improved exponentially.
            Similarly, natural language processing methods such as GPT-3 are continually being improved and outperformed. </p>
