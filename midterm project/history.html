        <p class="subtext">It all started in the stone age. Humans used to create hand axes using large stones as their all-around tool.
            Then they learned to use other resources like wood, textile, and clay to create more usable tools for their survival. That is how life was in the Stone Age.
            Around the same time, curiosity about the behavior of metallic oxides in the presence of fire fueled one of the most profound technological discoveries of all time, ushering in the Metal Age.
            Another fundamental technique achieved at some unknown point during the Old Stone Age was the use of fire.
            The discovery that fire could be tamed and controlled, as well as the subsequent discovery that fire might be produced by persistent friction between two dry wooden surfaces, was historic.
            Fire was prehistory's most significant contribution to power technology. And since then, humans have developed technology to where we are today, and are still developing for new tech for the future generations.
